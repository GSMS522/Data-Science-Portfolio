The same modeling approach could be applied in the energy sector to predict residential electricity consumption based on household characteristics, weather variables, and historical usage patterns. A multiple linear regression model could be used as a baseline to estimate monthly energy demand, with careful variable selection and out‑of‑sample testing to ensure robustness. This would support utilities in load forecasting and infrastructure planning. The emphasis on significance testing and generalization would help avoid overfitting to short‑term consumption trends.
