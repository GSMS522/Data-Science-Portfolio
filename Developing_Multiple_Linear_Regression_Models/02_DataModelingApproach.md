The data consisted of clinical measurements from 442 diabetes patients. The predictors included demographic variables such as age and sex, physiological measures like body mass index and blood pressure, and several blood serum measurements. The response variable represented disease progression measured one year after baseline. All predictor variables were numeric, with one categorical variable (sex) explicitly converted to a categorical data type to reflect its qualitative nature. The primary modeling technique applied was multiple linear regression using ordinary least squares (OLS). This approach was appropriate because the target variable was continuous and the goal was to understand linear relationships between predictors and outcomes. The modeling process began with a full model that included all available predictors, followed by iterative refinement based on statistical significance and predictive performance. A train–test split was used to separate model fitting from evaluation, which allowed for assessment of how well the model generalized beyond the training data.
