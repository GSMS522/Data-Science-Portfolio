The core problem addressed in this assignment was predicting whether a retail loan would default or not default using borrower‑level financial and credit attributes. This is fundamentally a binary outcome problem, where the response variable represents membership in one of two categories rather than a continuous numeric value. From a business perspective, this problem is central to credit risk management, as loan defaults directly impact profitability, capital allocation, and underwriting strategy. This problem is particularly well suited for data and analytics because loan default is influenced by multiple interacting factors that are difficult to evaluate reliably using manual judgment alone. Variables such as credit score, income, payment burden, credit inquiries, and prior records all contribute incremental information about risk. Analytics enables these signals to be combined systematically, allowing for consistent, repeatable decision‑making. Additionally, the problem naturally aligns with probabilistic modeling, where the goal is not only to classify outcomes but to estimate the likelihood of default, which is essential for real‑world decision thresholds and risk trade‑offs.
