The data used in this assignment consists of historical attendance rates, summarized as a single probability: a 75% likelihood that a scheduled patient shows up. While minimal, this parameter captures the key uncertainty needed for the analysis. The workload capacity (30 patients per day) and the assumed independence of patient attendance events form the structural inputs to the model. The modeling approach relies on the binomial distribution, which is appropriate because each scheduled appointment can be viewed as a Bernoulli trial with two outcomes: show or no‑show. The total number of patients who arrive in a day is therefore the sum of independent trials with identical probabilities. This makes the binomial model a natural choice for describing the full range of possible realized workloads. The analysis begins with a linear heuristic, dividing capacity by the show‑up probability to estimate how many patients to schedule to stay busy on average. This produces an intuitive baseline but ignores variability. The binomial model is then used to move beyond averages by explicitly modeling the probability distribution of arrivals and quantifying the risk of exceeding capacity. Finally, inverse probability techniques are applied to determine a scheduling level that satisfies a predefined risk tolerance.
