Model performance is evaluated not through predictive accuracy but through decision relevance. The key metric is the probability of exceeding capacity, which directly reflects operational risk. Under the linear scheduling approach, the model reveals a surprisingly high likelihood of overload, demonstrating that matching expected demand to capacity does not control risk. The most important assessment criterion is how well the model captures variability and tail behavior, since extreme outcomes, such as days with too many arrivals, are operationally costly. By examining cumulative probabilities rather than just expected values, the analysis highlights tradeoffs between utilization and reliability. Several limitations are worth noting. The model assumes a constant show‑up probability and independence across patients, which may not hold in practice if attendance varies by time, patient type, or external factors. Additionally, the model treats all overload equally, ignoring the severity of exceeding capacity by different amounts. Despite these limitations, the framework is effective for illustrating how probabilistic modeling improves decision quality under uncertainty.
