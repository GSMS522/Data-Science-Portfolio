This assignment reinforces the importance of moving from deterministic thinking to probabilistic reasoning in analytics. A key takeaway is that decisions based on averages can be misleading when variability is significant. Explicitly modeling uncertainty enables clearer communication about risk and supports more defensible operational choices. If revisiting this analysis, one improvement would be incorporating heterogeneous attendance probabilities, such as differentiating between patient segments or appointment types. Another extension would be modeling the cost asymmetry between underutilization and overutilization, allowing optimization based on expected value rather than fixed risk thresholds. In real‑world settings, this approach directly applies to healthcare operations, service systems, and any environment where demand realization is uncertain but capacity is fixed. The assignment demonstrates how even simple probability models can substantially improve planning decisions.
