The problem addressed in this assignment was binary sentiment classification of movie reviews. Given free‑form textual reviews from the IMDb dataset, the objective was to determine whether each review expressed a positive or negative sentiment. This task is representative of a broader class of text classification problems where unstructured language must be converted into a form suitable for predictive modeling. This problem is well suited for data and analytics because it involves extracting signal from high‑dimensional, noisy, and unstructured data. Human language contains patterns, redundancies, and statistical regularities that can be learned from large corpora. Sentiment classification in particular has clear business relevance, such as analyzing customer feedback, monitoring brand perception, or prioritizing service issues. The availability of labeled data enables supervised learning, and performance can be objectively evaluated using held‑out test sets, making it an ideal candidate for applied machine learning.
