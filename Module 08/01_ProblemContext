The core problem addressed in this assignment was a collaborative filtering recommendation task, where the goal was to predict missing user–item ratings in a highly sparse dataset. Specifically, the dataset consisted of user ratings for songs, where only a small fraction of all possible user–song interactions were observed. The challenge was to infer the unobserved ratings in a principled way that leverages shared patterns across users and items rather than relying on explicit features or content metadata. This problem is well suited for data and analytics because it involves extracting latent structure from incomplete, noisy, and high‑dimensional data. Traditional rule‑based or descriptive approaches are ineffective in this setting due to the scale and sparsity of the interaction matrix. Instead, statistical learning and matrix factorization methods are required to uncover underlying patterns such as shared preferences, latent “taste dimensions,” and similarities among users and songs. The assignment reflects a common real‑world analytics challenge: making reliable predictions when the majority of data is missing and direct measurement is impossible.
