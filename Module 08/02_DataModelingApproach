The data consisted of triples of user IDs, song IDs, and ratings, which were transformed into a large user‑by‑song matrix. Each row represented a user, each column represented a song, and each observed rating populated a single cell. The vast majority of matrix entries were missing, which is typical in recommender system data and is a defining characteristic of collaborative filtering problems. The modeling approach applied was matrix completion using a low‑rank approximation, implemented through the SoftImpute algorithm. This method assumes that observed ratings can be explained by a small number of latent factors, such as archetypal listening preferences, and that both users and items can be represented in this lower‑dimensional space. Prior to applying the model, the data was normalized using a bi‑scaling procedure to stabilize the optimization process and reduce bias from users or songs with systematically higher or lower average ratings. This approach was appropriate because collaborative filtering relies on the assumption that user preferences are structured rather than random. By constraining the completed matrix to be low rank, the model avoids overfitting noise and instead focuses on the dominant patterns that explain shared behavior across users. The use of a training–validation split further supports the goal of generalization rather than memorization of observed ratings.
