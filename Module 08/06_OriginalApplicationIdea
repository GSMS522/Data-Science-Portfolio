An original application of these methods could be in corporate learning and training recommendations. Employees’ historical interactions with courses, certifications, and learning modules could be treated as a sparse user–item matrix, where missing entries represent unattempted training options. A low‑rank collaborative filtering model could infer latent skill interests and recommend personalized learning paths aligned with both employee preferences and organizational needs. This approach would be particularly valuable in large enterprises where manual training assignment is infeasible and learning engagement is highly uneven across teams.
