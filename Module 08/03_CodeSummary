The code performed four major tasks: data preparation, matrix construction, model fitting, and evaluation. First, the raw ratings data was loaded and transformed into a numerical array, with user and song identifiers mapped to contiguous indices suitable for matrix operations. This step ensured that the interaction matrix could be efficiently constructed and manipulated. Next, the code built an incomplete ratings matrix initialized with missing values and populated only at locations corresponding to observed ratings. A subset of these observed entries was then assigned to a training matrix, leaving the remaining entries for validation. This explicit separation of observed data enabled an out‑of‑sample evaluation of model performance. The modeling phase applied bi‑scaling normalization followed by SoftImpute, which iteratively estimated a low‑rank approximation of the training matrix. The algorithm effectively decomposed the matrix into latent components and reconstructed missing entries based on those components. After model fitting, the normalization was reversed to return predictions to the original rating scale. Key libraries used included NumPy and pandas for numerical operations and data handling, fancyimpute for matrix scaling, and scikit‑learn utilities for performance metrics. The overall logic focused on transforming sparse interaction data into a structured matrix problem, applying a regularized completion method, and generating predictions for unobserved user-song pairs.
