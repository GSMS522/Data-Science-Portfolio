The problem addressed in this assignment is slot filling for natural‑language travel queries, a structured prediction task where each word in a user query must be labeled with a semantic role. Given a sentence such as “I want to fly from Boston to Denver tomorrow morning”, the system must identify which tokens correspond to departure city, destination city, dates, times, or carry no semantic meaning. This is a significantly more complex task than simple intent classification because it requires understanding context, word order, and relationships between tokens within a sentence. This problem is highly appropriate for data and analytics because it sits at the intersection of unstructured data (text) and structured outputs (slot labels). Many real-world systems, such as search engines, conversational agents, booking platforms, and analytics tools, require converting free‑form text into structured representations that can be acted upon programmatically. Traditional rule‑based systems struggle with the variability and ambiguity of natural language, making this a strong candidate for machine learning approaches that can learn patterns directly from labeled data.
