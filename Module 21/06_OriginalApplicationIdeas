One original application of this same methodology would be clinical note structuring in healthcare. Doctors’ notes contain free‑form descriptions of symptoms, medications, dosages, and timelines. A Transformer‑based slot‑filling model could label each token with categories such as symptom, medication name, dosage, frequency, or condition, enabling automated extraction of structured medical data from unstructured text. Another application could be financial transaction interpretation, where user descriptions like “paid rent for January via bank transfer” are parsed into structured fields such as transaction type, amount, date, and category. In both cases, the same core ideas, positional embeddings, self‑attention, and token‑level classification, can be reused across entirely different domains, demonstrating the generality and power of the approach explored in this assignment.
