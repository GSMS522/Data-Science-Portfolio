The problem addressed in this assignment was to build an effective predictive model for a continuous outcome: a quantitative measure of diabetes disease progression one year after baseline clinical measurements. The objective was not only to fit a linear regression model, but to identify a model specification that balances explanatory power, interpretability, and generalization to unseen data. This required careful consideration of which predictors meaningfully contribute to the outcome and which introduce noise or instability. This problem is well suited for data and analytics because it involves multivariate relationships between patient characteristics and a measurable health outcome. The dataset contains multiple numeric predictors that are plausibly related to disease progression, making it an appropriate candidate for multiple linear regression. Additionally, the problem reflects a common real‑world analytics challenge: selecting and validating a model that performs well on future data rather than simply maximizing in‑sample fit.
