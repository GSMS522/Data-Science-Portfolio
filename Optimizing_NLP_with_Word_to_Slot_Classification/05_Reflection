This assignment reinforced the importance of contextual representations in natural language processing. Unlike traditional bag‑of‑words or n‑gram models, the Transformer encoder learns dynamic relationships between tokens, enabling it to generalize to cases not explicitly seen during training. Observing the model correctly label entities that were absent from the training set highlighted the power of attention‑based architectures. If revisiting this work, one improvement would be to experiment with class imbalance handling, as many slot types occur far less frequently than others. Techniques such as weighted loss functions or targeted data augmentation could further improve performance on rare slots. Another extension would be incorporating pre‑trained embeddings or initializing the model from a larger language model to reduce training time and improve generalization. In real‑world scenarios, this approach directly applies to systems that must translate user language into structured actions. Examples include customer support automation, enterprise search, analytics query interfaces, and conversational commerce platforms.
