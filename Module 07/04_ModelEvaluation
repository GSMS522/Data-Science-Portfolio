Model performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix, which breaks predictions into true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This structure is especially important in credit risk contexts because different types of errors carry very different costs. For example, incorrectly predicting that a borrower will not default when they actually do is typically far more costly than rejecting a borrower who would have repaid. Accuracy was also calculated as a high‑level summary metric, representing the proportion of correct predictions. While accuracy provides a useful starting point, it is not sufficient on its own, particularly in datasets where one outcome (non‑default) is much more common than the other. The evaluation process highlighted the importance of considering error trade‑offs and decision thresholds, rather than relying solely on a single metric. Limitations of the model include its reliance on historical data from approved loans only, which introduces selection bias. Additionally, logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between predictors and the log‑odds of default, which may oversimplify more complex borrower behavior. These limitations underscore the need for careful interpretation and ongoing model refinement.
