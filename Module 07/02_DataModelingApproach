The dataset consisted of historical loan records containing borrower characteristics and a binary indicator of whether the loan defaulted. Key features included credit quality metrics (such as FICO score), affordability indicators (income and installment size), and behavioral signals (credit inquiries and public records). These variables represent commonly used predictors in consumer credit modeling and are well grounded in financial risk theory. The primary modeling technique applied was logistic regression, a classification method designed to estimate the probability of a binary outcome. Logistic regression is appropriate in this context because it constrains predictions to values between 0 and 1, making them interpretable as probabilities. Unlike linear regression, which can produce nonsensical predictions for binary outcomes, logistic regression transforms a linear combination of inputs through a sigmoid function to produce valid probability estimates. This approach was suitable for several reasons. First, it provides interpretability, allowing coefficients to be examined to understand the direction and relative influence of each variable. Second, it is computationally efficient and robust for medium‑sized tabular datasets. Finally, logistic regression aligns well with regulatory and operational expectations in financial services, where transparency and explainability are critical.
