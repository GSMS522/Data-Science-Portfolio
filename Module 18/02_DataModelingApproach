The data consisted of approximately 5,000 ECG observations, each represented by 140 continuous numerical features corresponding to sequential points along an ECG waveform, along with a binary target variable indicating rhythm normality. All predictor variables were numeric, eliminating the need for categorical encoding but increasing the importance of feature scaling due to differences in magnitude across signal dimensions. The dataset exhibited class imbalance, with normal rhythms occurring more frequently than abnormal ones, which influenced both evaluation strategy and baseline comparison. The primary modeling technique applied was a feedforward neural network implemented using Keras on top of TensorFlow. The architecture included a fully connected input layer corresponding to the 140 ECG features, a single hidden layer with 16 neurons using a ReLU activation function, and a single‑node output layer with a sigmoid activation function to produce a probability for the positive class. This architecture was appropriate because the task involved binary classification with potentially nonlinear decision boundaries, and the relatively shallow network balanced expressive power with the risk of overfitting given the dataset size. The binary cross‑entropy loss function was selected to align with probabilistic binary outputs, and the Adam optimizer was used due to its efficiency and robustness for gradient‑based optimization.
