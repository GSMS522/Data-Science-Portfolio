Model performance was evaluated primarily using classification accuracy on a held‑out test set, supplemented by inspection of training and validation loss curves. Accuracy was an appropriate metric in this context because the business objective was correct classification of ECG rhythms, and the class distribution, while imbalanced, was not extreme enough to invalidate accuracy as a first‑order measure. The trained neural network achieved substantially higher accuracy than a naïve baseline that always predicted the majority class, demonstrating that the model learned meaningful structure from the ECG signals. Beyond raw accuracy, the relative stability of validation loss across training epochs was important in assessing generalization. While training loss continued to decrease steadily, validation loss flattened and exhibited minor fluctuations, indicating diminishing returns from additional training and suggesting mild overfitting risk. This tradeoff highlights a limitation of the approach: increasing model capacity or training duration can improve in‑sample performance without corresponding gains on unseen data. Additionally, the evaluation did not explicitly incorporate metrics such as recall or precision for the abnormal class, which could be important in clinical contexts where false negatives carry higher cost.
