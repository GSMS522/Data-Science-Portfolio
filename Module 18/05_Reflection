This assignment reinforced the importance of aligning model architecture, loss functions, and evaluation metrics with the underlying problem structure. In particular, it highlighted how relatively simple neural networks can be highly effective on structured, tabular representations of complex signals when proper preprocessing and normalization are applied. The exercise also emphasized the practical importance of validation curves as diagnostic tools rather than relying solely on final test accuracy. If revisiting this work, I would experiment more systematically with regularization strategies such as early stopping or alternative hidden layer sizes to better control overfitting. I would also incorporate additional evaluation metrics focused on class‑specific performance. In real‑world applications, especially in healthcare analytics, these methods translate directly to decision‑support systems where model interpretability, robustness, and error asymmetry must be carefully managed.
