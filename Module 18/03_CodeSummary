The code implemented a complete end‑to‑end modeling pipeline, beginning with data ingestion and ending with quantitative model evaluation. Key libraries included NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visualization, scikit‑learn for train‑test splitting, and TensorFlow/Keras for neural network modeling. These libraries collectively supported data preprocessing, model definition, training, and diagnostics. After loading the ECG data into a Pandas DataFrame, the target variable was separated from the predictors. The dataset was then split into training and test sets using a stratified sampling strategy to preserve class proportions. Feature normalization was performed using the mean and standard deviation computed from the training set only, and these statistics were applied consistently to both training and test data to prevent data leakage. The normalized DataFrames were converted into NumPy arrays to meet Keras input requirements. Model construction involved explicitly defining the input layer shape, adding a dense hidden layer with ReLU activation, and connecting it to a sigmoid output layer. The model was compiled with binary cross‑entropy loss, the Adam optimizer, and accuracy as the reporting metric. Training was performed over multiple epochs with mini‑batch gradient descent and an automatically generated validation split. During training, loss and accuracy metrics for both training and validation sets were tracked and later visualized to assess learning dynamics and potential overfitting.
