The same modeling approach could be applied to detecting anomalies in industrial sensor data from manufacturing equipment. For example, multivariate time‑series readings from vibration, temperature, and pressure sensors could be summarized into fixed‑length feature vectors and used to classify operating states as normal or fault‑prone. A neural network trained on historical labeled maintenance data could identify early warning signals of equipment failure. This would support predictive maintenance strategies, reducing downtime and operational costs. The binary classification framework and preprocessing steps used in the ECG problem transfer directly to this industrial context.
