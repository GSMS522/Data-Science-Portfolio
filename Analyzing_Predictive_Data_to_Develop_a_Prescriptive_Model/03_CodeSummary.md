The code performs three main analytical tasks. First, it computes a baseline scheduling estimate by scaling capacity by the inverse of the attendance probability. This produces a simple numerical estimate of how many patients should be booked to expect 30 arrivals on average. Second, the code constructs the probability mass function (PMF) of the binomial distribution for the number of patients who show up when a fixed number of appointments are scheduled. This involves enumerating all possible arrival counts and calculating their probabilities. The resulting distribution is visualized to illustrate how likely different workload levels are under the scheduling policy. Third, the code evaluates tail probabilities and decision thresholds. It calculates the cumulative probability that arrivals exceed the physician’s capacity, which represents the risk of being overworked. It then applies the inverse cumulative distribution function (percent‑point function) to determine the maximum number of appointments that can be scheduled while keeping the probability of overload below a specified limit (5%). Conceptually, this reverses the question from “what is the risk of a policy?” to “what policy meets a risk target?”
