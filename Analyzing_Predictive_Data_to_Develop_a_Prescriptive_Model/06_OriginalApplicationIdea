One original application of this method could be applying this model to airline gate assignments, where not all scheduled flights require gates simultaneously due to delays or early departures. Modeling arrival uncertainty would allow airports to overbook gates strategically while controlling congestion risk. By modeling flight arrivals as probabilistic events with delay distributions, airports could determine an optimal level of gate overbooking that maintains high gate utilization while bounding the probability of gate conflicts. This approach would allow planners to explicitly trade off congestion risk against infrastructure costs and adapt gate assignment policies dynamically based on time‑of‑day, weather patterns, or airline reliability.
