Subject: Optimal Production Mix for Craft Studio Furnishings

Overview
Following the application of Solver optimization, I have determined the most profitable production plan for Craft Studio Furnishings. The recommended mix maximizes earnings while fully respecting the operational constraints outlined by your team.

Optimal Weekly Production Plan
Table Chairs: 0
Easy Chairs: 4
Love Seats: 20
Coffee Tables: 10
End Tables: 10
Total Weekly Earnings: $2,316

Recommendation
This allocation of items prioritizes products with the highest earnings per unit of scarce resources. Coffee Tables and End Tables are maximized first as they deliver exceptional efficiency. Coffee Tables yield $55 per unit and End Tables yield $45 per unit while consuming a minimal number of hours for production. Table Chairs have been excluded from the final production numbers as they only generate $30 per unit and consume more hours to produce than alternative items. The proposed plan maximizes profitability under current constraints. It fully utilizes Frame Manufacturing and Finishing hours, respects the production limits, and achieves the highest possible revenue. I recommend adopting this production mix as the operational guideline for the upcoming cycle.
