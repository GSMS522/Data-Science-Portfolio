This assignment reinforced the distinction between regression and classification and clarified why modeling probabilities requires different assumptions and tools than predicting numeric outcomes. One key learning was how logistic regression extends linear modeling concepts while addressing their limitations in binary settings. The exercise also emphasized the importance of evaluating models in terms of business impact, not just statistical performance. If revisiting this assignment, more attention could be given to threshold tuning and alternative evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, or cost‑weighted outcomes. Additionally, deeper feature analysis or interaction effects could improve model insight. In real‑world scenarios, these techniques directly apply to credit underwriting, fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and any domain where decisions depend on balancing risk and reward under uncertainty.
