An original application of these methods would be predicting employee attrition risk in a large organization. Logistic regression could be used to estimate the probability that an employee will leave based on variables such as tenure, role changes, compensation history, performance ratings, and engagement survey results. This probability could inform targeted retention strategies rather than blanket interventions. As with credit risk, decision thresholds could be adjusted based on the cost of turnover versus the cost of retention efforts. This approach would provide both predictive power and interpretability for HR decision‑making.
