This assignment highlighted the importance of aligning model architecture with data structure. While a fully connected neural network can learn from image data, it does so inefficiently by ignoring spatial context. The convolutional model demonstrated how incorporating domain‑specific inductive bias leads to better performance with fewer parameters. The work also reinforced the value of preprocessing steps such as normalization and systematic model evaluation. Small changes in data preparation and architecture produced measurable differences in performance. If this project were extended, additional evaluation tools such as confusion matrices and misclassification analysis would provide deeper insight into model behavior. From a real‑world perspective, the workflow closely resembles applied machine learning projects in industry. Analysts often begin with a simple baseline, evaluate its limitations, and then introduce more specialized techniques to improve results while balancing complexity and interpretability.
