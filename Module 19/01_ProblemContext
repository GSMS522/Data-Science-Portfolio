The goal was to build and evaluate an image classification model capable of identifying clothing items from grayscale images. The task used the Fashion‑MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 labeled images across ten clothing categories, including items such as shirts, trousers, sneakers, and ankle boots. Each image is represented as a 28×28 grid of pixel intensity values, and each image is associated with a single categorical label. This problem is well suited for data and analytics because it requires transforming high‑dimensional, unstructured data into actionable predictions. Image data does not arrive in a tabular format, so analytical value must be extracted through feature learning rather than manual feature engineering. The assignment also mirrors real‑world analytical workflows by emphasizing model validation, generalization to unseen data, and performance comparison across different modeling approaches. Establishing a baseline model and then improving upon it using techniques that better align with the data structure reflects common practice in applied analytics and machine learning.
