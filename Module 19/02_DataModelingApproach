The dataset was provided in predefined training and test splits. The training set contained 60,000 images, while the test set contained 10,000 images. Each image was stored as a two‑dimensional array of grayscale pixel values ranging from 0 to 255, and each label was an integer representing one of ten clothing categories. A label lookup table was used to map numeric class identifiers to descriptive category names, which aided interpretability during exploration and validation. Two modeling approaches were implemented. The first was a fully connected neural network that treated each image as a flat feature vector. In this approach, each 28×28 image was flattened into a single vector of 784 values and passed through a hidden layer with ReLU activation, followed by a softmax output layer producing class probabilities. The second approach used a convolutional neural network designed specifically for image data. Before modeling, the images were reshaped to include a channel dimension, converting each input to a 28×28×1 tensor. The CNN architecture consisted of two convolutional blocks, each containing a convolutional layer with ReLU activation followed by max pooling. The learned feature maps were then flattened and passed to a softmax output layer. These approaches were appropriate for the problem for different reasons. The dense neural network provided a simple baseline to confirm that the pixel data contained sufficient signal for classification. The convolutional neural network leveraged spatial locality and shared weights, allowing it to learn image features such as edges and textures more efficiently. Both models were trained using the Adam optimizer and optimized with sparse categorical cross‑entropy loss, which is well suited for multi‑class classification problems with integer‑encoded labels.
