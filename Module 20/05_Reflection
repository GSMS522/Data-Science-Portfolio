This assignment reinforced the importance of feature representation in machine learning, particularly for unstructured data. A significant portion of model performance was driven not by architectural complexity, but by how text was encoded numerically. The exercise also highlighted how neural networks can extract meaningful patterns even from relatively coarse representations. If revisiting the problem, I would experiment more systematically with vocabulary size, n‑gram features, and alternative encoding strategies to balance expressiveness and overfitting. I would also compare the neural network baseline against simpler linear models to better quantify the marginal benefit of added complexity. In real‑world scenarios, this workflow directly translates to applications such as review moderation, survey analysis, and customer feedback triage. The ability to rapidly prototype and evaluate sentiment models enables organizations to scale insights from text data that would otherwise require extensive manual review.
