A natural extension of this approach would be classifying internal support tickets by urgency in an enterprise IT environment. Text descriptions of incidents could be vectorized using the same multi‑hot encoding strategy and used to predict priority levels or routing categories. This would allow faster triage and more efficient allocation of technical resources. Over time, model predictions could be incorporated into automated workflows to reduce response times and improve service quality.
