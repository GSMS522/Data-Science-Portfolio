The same modeling approach could be applied to predict loan default risk in consumer finance. Using borrower demographics, credit history metrics, payment behavior, and loan characteristics, an XGBoost classifier could identify high‑risk applicants before loan approval. The model’s ability to capture nonlinear interactions would be especially valuable for detecting subtle combinations of risk factors. Feature importance could then be used to support regulatory reporting and risk governance. This approach would enable lenders to balance profitability with responsible credit decisions.
