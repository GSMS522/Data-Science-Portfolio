Model performance was evaluated primarily using classification accuracy on training, validation, and test datasets. The dense neural network achieved strong training accuracy but showed a modest drop in performance on the test set, indicating limited generalization. This behavior is consistent with a model that does not explicitly exploit spatial relationships in image data. The convolutional neural network achieved higher test accuracy than the baseline model, demonstrating improved generalization to unseen images. The CNN’s ability to learn localized patterns contributed to more robust feature representations and better classification performance. Although the improvement in absolute accuracy may appear moderate, it represents a meaningful reduction in classification error for a multi‑class image problem. Accuracy was the primary success metric, as the objective was correct class prediction. However, the evaluation did not examine class‑level performance or confusion patterns, which limits insight into specific misclassification behaviors. Additionally, the CNN architecture was intentionally simple, leaving room for further gains through deeper networks, regularization techniques, or architectural tuning.
