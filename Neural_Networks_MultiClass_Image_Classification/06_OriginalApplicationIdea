A practical extension of these methods would be automated defect detection in manufacturing using grayscale camera images from an assembly line. Each image could be classified into categories such as surface defect, alignment issue, contamination, or no defect. A convolutional neural network similar to the one used in this assignment would be well suited to learn subtle visual patterns associated with quality issues. The model’s predictions could be integrated into real‑time quality control systems to flag items for inspection or rework. Over time, newly labeled defects could be incorporated to continuously improve model accuracy.
