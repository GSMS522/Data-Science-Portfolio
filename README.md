# Data-Science-Portfolio
Portfolio of work for MIT Data Science and Analytics course. 

As a Master Data Coordinator with a deep interest in transforming information into meaningful insight, I entered the Data Science and Analytics program with a clear goal: to expand my technical capabilities and strengthen the analytical mindset required to support data‑driven decision‑making. Throughout this semester, I have explored the foundations of data science—from statistical reasoning and data visualization to predictive modeling and practical applications of machine learning.

This portfolio represents the progression of my learning journey. It highlights the skills I have developed, the tools and methodologies I have practiced, and the ways I have begun integrating analytical thinking into my professional work. More importantly, it reflects my commitment to continuous growth in a field that is rapidly evolving and increasingly essential across industries.

By documenting my projects, reflections, and newly acquired competencies, I aim to demonstrate not only what I have learned, but how I plan to apply these capabilities to create value, improve processes, and contribute to more informed organizational strategies. This portfolio marks an important step in my transition from data coordination to deeper analytical practice, and I look forward to building on this foundation as I advance in my career.
