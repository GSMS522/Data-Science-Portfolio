The problem addressed in the portfolio assignment is a capacity planning and overbooking decision for a physician who can treat a maximum of 30 patients per day but faces uncertainty due to patient no‑shows. Historical data indicates that approximately 25% of scheduled patients do not attend their appointments, creating a tension between underutilization (lost revenue) and overutilization (physician overload and overtime). The core decision problem is determining how many patients should be scheduled each day to balance these competing risks. This problem is well suited for data and analytics because the uncertainty in patient attendance can be quantified probabilistically. Rather than relying on deterministic averages, the decision involves understanding the distribution of outcomes, specifically, how many patients actually arrive on a given day, and evaluating the likelihood of exceeding the physician’s capacity. Analytics enables translating historical attendance behavior into a formal model that supports risk‑aware decision making, rather than intuition or simple heuristics.
