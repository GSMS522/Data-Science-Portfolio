The code implemented a complete regression workflow, from data ingestion to out‑of‑sample evaluation. It began by importing standard data science and statistical libraries, including NumPy and pandas for data manipulation, statsmodels for regression modeling, and scikit‑learn utilities for dataset splitting and performance evaluation. After loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame, the code performed basic inspection to confirm data types, missing values, and summary statistics. The sex variable was explicitly cast to a categorical type to ensure it was treated appropriately in the regression model. Descriptive statistics were generated to understand the distribution and scale of each variable. The dataset was then randomly split into training and test subsets, with 70% of observations used for training and 30% reserved for testing. On the training data, a full OLS regression model was fit using all predictors. A constant term was added to capture the intercept. The resulting model summary provided coefficient estimates, standard errors, t‑statistics, p‑values, and goodness‑of‑fit metrics. Based on statistical significance, predictors with high p‑values were removed, and a reduced model was refit using only the remaining variables. This reduced model was then used to generate predictions on the held‑out test dataset. Model performance was quantified using out‑of‑sample R², allowing comparison between in‑sample fit and generalization performance.
