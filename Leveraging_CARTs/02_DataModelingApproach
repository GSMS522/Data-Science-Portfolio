The dataset consisted of 768 observations with eight numeric predictor variables and a single binary outcome variable. All predictors were structured, tabular features, making the data particularly appropriate for tree‑based ensemble methods. The dataset did not require extensive feature engineering, as all variables were already in numeric form and represented meaningful clinical measurements. The primary modeling technique applied was gradient‑boosted decision trees using XGBoost. XGBoost was selected because it is designed to handle nonlinear relationships, interactions between variables, and varying feature importance without requiring manual specification. The model was configured for binary classification using a logistic objective function, allowing predicted outputs to be interpreted as class probabilities. This approach was appropriate because boosted trees iteratively correct errors made by previous models, enabling the ensemble to focus on harder‑to‑classify observations. In health‑related prediction problems where subtle patterns can materially affect outcomes, this adaptive learning process often outperforms single‑model approaches.
