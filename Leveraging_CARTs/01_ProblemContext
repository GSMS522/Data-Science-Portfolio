The problem addressed in this assignment was a binary classification task: predicting whether an individual has diabetes based on a set of physiological and demographic health indicators. The target variable “Outcome” represents the presence or absence of diabetes, while the predictors include clinical measures such as glucose concentration, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, insulin levels, age, and related attributes. This problem is well suited for data and analytics because it involves identifying nonlinear relationships and interactions among multiple continuous predictors that jointly influence a health outcome. Medical datasets of this type often exhibit complex patterns that are difficult to capture using simple linear models. Additionally, the problem has a clear decision‑making context, risk identification, which aligns well with supervised machine learning classification techniques designed to maximize predictive accuracy while managing tradeoffs between false positives and false negatives.
