This assignment reinforced the practical value of ensemble methods for structured data, particularly when relationships between predictors and outcomes are complex. A key takeaway was how boosting incrementally improves performance by focusing learning capacity on prior errors rather than treating all observations equally. If this analysis were repeated, additional steps such as hyperparameter optimization using cross‑validation could further improve robustness and generalizability. Exploring probability calibration and threshold tuning would also be beneficial for decision‑oriented deployment scenarios. In real‑world applications, this approach directly translates to problems involving risk scoring, eligibility classification, or early detection, where predictive accuracy and ranking quality are more important than simple model interpretability.
