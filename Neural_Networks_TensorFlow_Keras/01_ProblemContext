The problem addressed in this assignment was the detection of abnormal heart rhythms from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using supervised learning. Specifically, the task was framed as a binary classification problem in which each ECG observation was labeled as either normal or abnormal. Each observation consisted of a fixed-length numerical representation of an ECG waveform, capturing temporal signal behavior across 140 ordered data points. The objective was to learn a mapping from these high‑dimensional signal features to a binary outcome that reliably distinguishes pathological rhythms from normal cardiac activity. This problem is well suited for data and analytics because ECG signals are complex, high‑dimensional, and noisy, making them difficult to analyze with simple rule‑based or threshold approaches. Machine learning methods, and neural networks in particular, are effective in this setting because they can model nonlinear relationships and interactions across many correlated features. The availability of labeled historical ECG data further supports a supervised learning approach, allowing model performance to be empirically evaluated and compared against simple baselines.
